Over the course of the semester in offhand comments during class, you've shared things you've been enjoying recently outside of (and also within) the physics world. If you'd like to share them with the class, let me know and I can post your recommendations here.

As for me, if I were in your shoes I would sit down with the final for a day, kicking off with with Melissa Clark's 
[Shakshuka with Feta](https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1014721-shakshuka-with-feta) and giving it a solid read
while listening to Chick Corea's [Rendezvous in New York](https://open.spotify.com/album/2CGHnDwtTgjIQTMlbpgJu6?si=7PxD32viSBaSswGyPl7pvw).
(I rediscovered this album recently after about ten years; Concierto De Aranjuez / Spain is particularly good --- the one with Rubalcaba, in particular).
A computationally intensive part of the exam might benefit from an upbeat throwback to Daft Punk's 2013 [Random Access Memories](https://open.spotify.com/user/jessandjim10.2/playlist/5FGSV4WAD5r42dtVcGZBom?si=OeLBsPKaQLuxJtYJgpr1Uw),
or (of course) [Hamilton](https://open.spotify.com/album/1kCHru7uhxBUdzkm4gzRQc?si=OTnU9eDvSESTAxY_wOQ22Q) for something more cerebral.

For post-semester physics reading, you're looking for [The Elegant Universe](https://www.amazon.com/Elegant-Universe-Superstrings-Dimensions-Ultimate/dp/039333810X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1544107166&sr=8-1&keywords=elegant+universe)
for string theory, [Genius](https://www.amazon.com/Genius-Life-Science-Richard-Feynman/dp/0679747044/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1544107218&sr=8-1&keywords=genius+gleick)
for a Feynman biography or [Einstein: His Life and Universe](https://www.amazon.com/Einstein-Life-Universe-Walter-Isaacson/dp/0743264746/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid=1544107263&sr=8-3&keywords=einstein+biography)
for an Einstein biography, [The First Three Minutes](https://www.amazon.com/First-Three-Minutes-Modern-Universe/dp/0465024378/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1544107296&sr=8-1&keywords=the+first+three+minutes)
for "A Modern View of the Origin of the Universe" (except that it is a few decades old). If you prefer watching to reading after a hard semester, [Particle Fever](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHObwzAg7Q0) is a classic from
a few years ago.

If you enjoyed my occasional blabbering about complexity, the video [P vs. NP and the Computational Complexity Zoo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX40hbAHx3s&t=515s)
is a gentle introduction to central concepts in complexity theory; [Aaronson's review](https://www.scottaaronson.com/papers/pnp.pdf)
is less gentle, but extremely thorough. For a recent venture of mine into complexity, see [Computational Complexity of Vacua and Near-Vacua in Field and String Theory](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.08279).
For one of the bigger breakthroughs in AI, see [Mastering the game of Go without human knowledge](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature24270).

If you're looking for recommendations in any particular physics area, let me know and I can give it a shot.
